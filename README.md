### Overview

This was a project completed for the Data Science Immersive class at General Assembly.

* "For our first project, we're going to take a look at SAT and ACT scores around the United States."
* "Suppose that the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - seeks to improve the participation rate of its exams."
* "Your presentation should be geared toward **non-technical** executives with the College Board and you will use, at minimum, the provided data to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rates of these exams."

### Key Points
* More students are taking the SAT than ever before
* SAT Participation Differs by Regions
* Average ACT participation is much higher than SAT
* In most states, only one test tends to dominate
* As ACT participation goes up, SAT tends to go down
* Correlation between SAT and ACT participation
* Higher participation is associated with lower scores

## This project included usage of python's Folium library
* [Here's a blog post I wrote about this experience](https://medium.com/@austinlasseter/using-folium-to-generate-a-simple-map-of-your-pandas-data-87ddc5d55f8d)
